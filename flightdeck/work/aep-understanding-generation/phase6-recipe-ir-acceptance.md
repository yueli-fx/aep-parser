# Phase 6 Recipe IR Acceptance

## Inputs

- Recipe: `examples/recipes/minimal-text-shape.json`
- Generated AEP: `tmp_debug/recipes/minimal-text-shape.aep`
- Render request: `tmp_debug/aeoracle/minimal_recipe/request.json`
- AE executable: `E:\adobe\Adobe After Effects 2025\Support Files\AfterFX.exe`

## Commands

```powershell
go run ./cmd/aeprecipe compile -recipe examples\recipes\minimal-text-shape.json -out tmp_debug\recipes\minimal-text-shape.aep -json
go run ./cmd/aeoracle plan -aep tmp_debug\recipes\minimal-text-shape.aep -out tmp_debug\aeoracle\minimal_recipe -json
go run ./cmd/aeoracle render -request tmp_debug\aeoracle\minimal_recipe\request.json -ae 'E:\adobe\Adobe After Effects 2025\Support Files\AfterFX.exe' -timeout-sec 600
```

## Result

- `cmd/aeprecipe compile` returned a valid report and wrote
  `tmp_debug/recipes/minimal-text-shape.aep`.
- `cmd/aeoracle plan` selected 3 sentinel frames:
  - `f000000`, frame 0, comp start
  - `f000060`, frame 60, quiet midpoint
  - `f000120`, frame 120, comp end
- `cmd/aeoracle render` passed on AE `25.1x68`.
- Done marker: `tmp_debug/aeoracle/minimal_recipe/aeoracle_render.done` = `ok`
- Metadata: `tmp_debug/aeoracle/minimal_recipe/metadata.json`, status `ok`
- PNG outputs:
  - `tmp_debug/aeoracle/minimal_recipe/f000000.png`
  - `tmp_debug/aeoracle/minimal_recipe/f000060.png`
  - `tmp_debug/aeoracle/minimal_recipe/f000120.png`

## Interpretation

The minimal recipe IR can now compile a one-comp text/shape recipe into an AEP
using exported writer APIs, and the generated AEP opens and renders through the
generic AE oracle. This proves the first deterministic generation slice, not an
AI correction loop.

Follow-up completed after this gate:

- `cmd/aeprecipe` now loads `docs/capabilities.json` through reusable
  `internal/capindex` instead of using a temporary static map.
- Recipe reports include used capabilities and downgrades.
- Effect requests are explicitly refused until this recipe compiler slice can
  materialize them; they are no longer silently dropped.
- The stale `SetLayerTransform` capability boundary was corrected and
  `docs/capabilities.{json,md}` were regenerated.

Next generation work should broaden recipe coverage in small proven slices,
starting with effect materialization or richer shape/text controls, each gated
by profile and render-oracle evidence.
